# AI Nutrition Coach (CLI)

**AI Nutrition Coach** is a Python-based CLI application that generates a personalized 7-day meal plan using the OpenAI GPT-4.1 API. It takes user input such as name, age, height, weight, and a weekly health goal, then calculates BMI, prompts the OpenAI model, and reads the plan aloud using text-to-speech with selectable male or female voices.

## ðŸ§  Features

- âœ… Accepts user input for age, weight, height, and health goal
- âœ… Calculates BMI automatically
- âœ… Uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1 to generate a customized meal plan (3 meals/day Ã— 7 days)
- âœ… Includes macros: protein, carbs, and fats for each meal
- âœ… Saves the plan to a timestamped `.txt` file for future use
- âœ… Reads the plan aloud with either a male or female voice using `pyttsx3`
